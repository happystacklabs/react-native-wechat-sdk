# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to React Native Wechat SDK. It's people like you that make React Native Wechat SDK such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

React Native Wechat SDK is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into React Native Wechat SDK itself.

# Ground Rules

## Responsibilities
  * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
  * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements
  * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
  * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
  * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
  * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.


Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).


At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

  * Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
  * If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
  * If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
  * Ensure the test suite passes.
  * Make sure your code lints.

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email heinrich.tremblay@hec.ca instead.

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in React Native Wechat SDK, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that React Native Wechat SDK has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
